The copyboy script is a script built in python 3.7 (runs in 3.9).
When running this script, it must be modified for the resolution of the screen.
It systematically counts how many "pages" it has  loaded, takes screenshots of the area
    that is the parameters of the screen... the moves the mouse curser to the 'button' that 
    allows you to move to the next page.

This program is a little glitchy and may require some tweaking, specifically the parameters for the screen
    resolution, as well as the area of the snapshot being taken.
